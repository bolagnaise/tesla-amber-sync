# Tesla Amber Sync - Home Assistant Integration

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

A Home Assistant custom integration that synchronizes Amber Electric pricing with Tesla Powerwall Time-of-Use (TOU) schedules, enabling cost-optimized battery management.

## Features

- **Automatic TOU Synchronization**: Continuously syncs Amber Electric's 5-minute price updates to your Tesla Powerwall
- **Real-time Price Monitoring**: Track current electricity prices including wholesale and network components
- **Energy Flow Monitoring**: Monitor solar generation, grid usage, battery power, and home consumption
- **Cost Optimization**: Tesla Powerwall automatically charges during low-price periods and discharges during high-price periods
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup through Home Assistant's UI
- **Leverages Official Integration**: Uses the official Home Assistant Tesla Fleet integration

## Prerequisites

Before installing this integration, you need:

1. **Home Assistant** (version 2024.8.0 or newer)
2. **Tesla Fleet Integration** configured in Home Assistant with:
   - Tesla account with Powerwall or Powerwall+
   - Tesla Developer account and application
   - Virtual keys configured
3. **Amber Electric Account** with:
   - Active electricity plan
   - API token from [Amber Developer Portal](https://app.amber.com.au/developers)

## Installation

### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click on "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL: `https://github.com/benboller/tesla-amber-sync`
6. Select category: "Integration"
7. Click "Add"
8. Find "Tesla Amber Sync" in HACS and click "Install"
9. Restart Home Assistant

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the `custom_components/tesla_amber_sync` folder from this repository
2. Copy the folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory:
   ```
   <config_dir>/custom_components/tesla_amber_sync/
   ```
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for **Tesla Amber Sync**
4. Follow the configuration steps:
   - **Step 1**: Confirmation that Tesla Fleet is configured
   - **Step 2**: Enter your Amber Electric API token
   - **Step 3**: Select your Tesla energy site and enable/disable auto-sync

## Entities

Once configured, the integration creates the following entities:

### Sensors

- **Current Electricity Price** ($/kWh)
  - Attributes: Price spike status, wholesale price, network price
- **Solar Power** (W)
- **Grid Power** (W)
- **Battery Power** (W)
- **Home Load** (W)
- **Battery Level** (%)

### Switches

- **Auto-Sync TOU Schedule**
  - Enable/disable automatic TOU schedule synchronization
  - Attributes: Last sync time, sync status

## Services

The integration provides the following services:

### `tesla_amber_sync.sync_tou_schedule`

Manually trigger a sync of the Time-of-Use schedule from Amber to Tesla.

```yaml
service: tesla_amber_sync.sync_tou_schedule
```

### `tesla_amber_sync.sync_now`

Immediately refresh data from Amber Electric and Tesla.

```yaml
service: tesla_amber_sync.sync_now
```

## Automations

You can create automations based on price data. For example, to notify when prices spike:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Notify on Price Spike"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.current_electricity_price
    condition:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ state_attr('sensor.current_electricity_price', 'price_spike') == 'spike' }}"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Electricity price spike detected!"
```

## How It Works

1. **Price Fetching**: Every 5 minutes, the integration fetches current and forecast prices from Amber Electric
2. **Tariff Conversion**: Prices are converted to Tesla's TOU tariff format with 30-minute intervals
3. **TOU Upload**: The tariff is uploaded to your Tesla Powerwall via the Tesla Fleet API
4. **Battery Optimization**: Tesla's onboard algorithms automatically optimize battery charge/discharge based on the TOU schedule

### Rolling 24-Hour Window

The integration implements a rolling 24-hour price window:
- Future periods (not yet reached today) use today's forecast prices
- Past periods (already passed today) use tomorrow's forecast prices
- This ensures Tesla always has a full 24-hour lookahead for optimization

### Price Advance Notice

Prices are shifted left by one 30-minute slot to give Tesla advance notice:
- If there's a price spike at 5:00 PM, the battery knows about it at 4:30 PM
- This allows the battery 30 minutes to prepare (charge before spike, discharge during spike, etc.)

## Energy Flow Charts

The integration provides real-time power flow data that can be visualized using Home Assistant's Energy Dashboard or custom Lovelace cards.

Example Lovelace card configuration:

```yaml
type: entities
title: Energy Flow
entities:
  - entity: sensor.solar_power
  - entity: sensor.grid_power
  - entity: sensor.battery_power
  - entity: sensor.home_load
  - entity: sensor.battery_level
```

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Not Showing Up

- Ensure Tesla Fleet integration is configured first
- Check Home Assistant logs for errors
- Restart Home Assistant after installation

### No Price Data

- Verify your Amber API token is correct
- Check that your Amber account has an active electricity plan
- Ensure you have internet connectivity

### TOU Not Syncing to Tesla

- Verify Tesla Fleet integration is working (check Tesla entities)
- Enable debug logging to see detailed sync information
- Check Tesla Developer Dashboard for API usage limits

### Enable Debug Logging

Add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.tesla_amber_sync: debug
```

## Cost Savings

By syncing Amber's real-time pricing to your Tesla Powerwall:

- **Charge during cheap periods**: Battery charges when grid prices are low
- **Discharge during expensive periods**: Battery powers your home when grid prices are high
- **Export optimization**: Sell excess solar at the best prices
- **Spike protection**: Automatically avoid high-price periods

Typical savings range from 20-40% on electricity bills compared to fixed-rate plans, depending on your usage patterns and solar generation.
